## Challenges During this Project

1. I had some challenges during this project such as figuring out how to use Axios in React, but after watching videos on Youtube about using axios and a reaching out to my instructor. I was able to find an easier way to use Axios with React.

2. Another challenge I faced was troubleshooting error when testing if my router were working. After a few hours I found out I was missing a {} and had some code in the wrong location.

## Future Plains for Pokemon Card App:

Most likely look into using the pokeapi from pokeapi.co to get information for my pokemon cards so it can appear a long side with just the image of the pokemon.
